                <p class="bio-top">Colombian native Julio Martinez moved to the United States two years ago and settled in Denver Colorado. Julio began dancing at the ripe age of 10 years old for the National Ballet of Colombia. Julio also studied with the well-known choreographer and dancer Romir Echeverry and performed for his artistic dance company for six years.</p>
                <p class="bio">Julio has danced for and performed with the following dance companies: Tierra Colombiana Ballet (Ballet and Colombian folk), Herencia Viva Dance Group (Afro-Colombian dance), Bacata Cultural Center (Jazz, Contemporary and classic training group), Alma Latina and Salsa Na’ma (Colombian style salsa). Julio also became a member of the Barajas Academy Theater and The Barraca Theater where he fell in love of the art of acting.</p>
                <p class="bio">Julio’s professional teaching skills developed at a young age working as an instructor for summer camps and as an instructor for the Colombian Institute of Learning INCAP. Julio also created the Artistic foundation Kairos Pasion, dedicated to exploring, learning and performing multiple rhymes of the Colombian Folk dance, Ballroom dancing and International dances. Julio and his dance company won two different choreography awards from the Local and Mayor Office in Bogotá, Colombia and were invited to perform at several national festivals.</p>
                <p class="bio">Julio’s newest venture is creating and directing Denver’s finest children’s Latin dance performing company: Latin Explosive Movement. Julio’s company strives to promote cultural diversity through the art of dance.  </p>
