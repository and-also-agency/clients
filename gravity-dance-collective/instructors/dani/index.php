                <p class="bio bio-top">Dani Worthman has lived in Colorado as long as she’s been dancing—since the age of two. She studied mainly under her mother’s direction until the age of 11 when she began dancing competitively with Shelly True Dance Academy and continued dancing competitively through high school. During this time she also worked as a dance captain for Magic Moments Productions, taught dance workshops at local summer camps, and co-instructed at Red Rocks Community College.</p>
                <p class="bio">Dani continued on to dance intermittently during the time she studied abroad in Croatia as well as through attaining her Bachelors of Science degree in Business Management from the University of Colorado Denver.</p>
                <p class="bio">Dani now teaches adult Tap at Gravity Dance Collective. She is grateful to have found a positive, welcoming group with which to share her passion for dance—somewhere she can dance for the love of its art, while empowering others to do the same.</p>
