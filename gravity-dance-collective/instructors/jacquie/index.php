                <p class="bio">"I hope you'll come and join us for an awesome class every week for Afro Caribe; a high cardio dance fitness fusion class. We loosen and strengthen the muscles in our hips, and around our spine and all over the body as we dance West African, Caribbean and Latin rhythms. You will strengthen and tone up your body, burn calories and fall deeper in love with your body. I love sharing this Denver-original dance class with everyone. It's a place to reclaim your body and dance to music that connects to your soul. I am a huge advocate for movement as a healing art. As a registered psychotherapist trained in Dance/Movement therapy &amp; Body Psychotherapy, I am deeply passionate about creating a safe, uplifting, community-oriented class every time so not only do you get a fantastic workout, but you also experience authentic stress relief and healing of some sort through movement. I truly look forward to seeing you in class soon!"
