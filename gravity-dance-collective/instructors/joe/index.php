          <p class="bio bio-top">Joe Gonzales was born and raised in Denver, Colorado. After studying the Brazilian martial art Capoeira, Joe began training in break dancing. Joe began his teaching career by participating in the creation of a dance program through an after school program called Heart in Hand for Denver Public Schools. This program focuses on giving inner city children a safe place to go after school where they can focus on tutoring for academics and can participate in extracurricular activities.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">Joe has also co-created an after school dance program at the school he graduated from, North High School, which focuses on dance instruction for students interested in learning dance. As a professional dancer, Joe has competed in numerous b-boy events in Colorado along with his crew Inner City Breakerz.
          </p>
          <p class="bio">Joe has also actively raised money via fundraising events for various Colorado b-boy events, for local Denver College and University events, and other non-profit events unrelated to dance.
